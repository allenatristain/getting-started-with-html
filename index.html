<h2>The Basics of the Web and HTML</h2>

<b>Basic Idea of the Web and How it Works</b>

<p>The main components of the web are <em>computers, web browsers, servers, internet, content,</em> and <em>HTTP</em>. The web is the entire collection of interconnected computers and servers which communicate with each other via a protocol known as HTTP. When an individual user visits a web page, the user’s web browser makes a <em>HTTP request</em>, which is sent over the internet, to the server hosting the appropriate <em>HTML document</em>. The server then sends back the HTML document to the user’s computer,which is then interpreted and displayed by the user’s web browser.</P> 

<b>Computers are Stupid and Effective</b>

<p>Computers are able to perform tasks which are encoded via a <em>computer language</em> such as HTML. While able to perform complex tasks more effectively than humans, any little error in the code can have huge problems and prevent the code from performing the desired task. 
Computers read code literally with no room for interpretation or understanding.</p>  

<b>HTML and HTML Elements</b>

<p>This first lesson detailed some of the key points of HTML, otherwise known as <em>HyperText Markup Language.</em> HTML documents comprise the majority of the content on the internet. HTML documents contain <em>text content</em>, which is the content seen by users, and <em>markup</em>,which controls how the text content looks. Each HTML document is comprised of <em>HTML elements</em>. These elements come in different sorts and are determined via <em>tags</em>.
</p>

<b>Types of Tags</b>

<p><b>“B” tag</b> - Makes the text content bold. <br>
<b>“M” tag</b> - Makes the text content initialized. <br>
<b>“Break” tag</b> - Makes an one line break, has no closing tag. <br>
<b>“Paragraph” tag</b> - Creates an "invisible box" around the text content. <br>
<b>“Anchor” tag</b> - Makes a link to another page. <br>  
<b>“Img” tag</b> - Tags an image. 
</p>

<b>Element and Tag Lingo</b>

<p><b>Inline/Block</b>- Elements come in either sort. Block 
elements make an "invisible box" around text content and can have a determinable height and length.<br>
<b>Void Tag</b> - A tag with no closing tag.</p>
